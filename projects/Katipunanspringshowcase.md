The Katipunan Spring Showcase is an annual spring semester event held by the Katipunan Club at UH Manoa. It is a film showcasing composed of multiple Filipino classes who have created a music video based on that years theme. It is also called Katipunan Got Talent (KGT) in the Fall semester.

My role in this school project was act in the film as well as contribute in creating dialogue scripts. Since it is a Filipino class project, we had to also had to translate from english and or create dialogue in Tagalog (Filipino). Each of us had a different role in creating the project, whether that was filming, editing, creating dialogue, directing, and providing costumes. But for the most part, everyone had to act/be in the film for atleast one scene.
The film in my opinon was a mix of a comedy, mystery, and soap opera. It starts off with a lovely scene between a couple, then goes onto musical introductions, like in the show Friends. Then turns into a mystery when one of the characers dies (the girlfriend at the beginning).

What I learned from the experience was communication and time management. We all did have roles to fulfil in creating the project, but a lot of it also delved into each of each others roles. In terms of time management, we had to find specific timeâ€™s in which only certain amount of people could participate in, due to other obligations such as work and morning vs afternoon class takers. Meaning we would have to adjust what scenes needed changing to include a different actor. Some people lived closer to a certain store which had specific materials for our costumes. Also if one had more ideas in directing and others agreed, it would make sense to fulfil that requested scene. Overall creating a smoothing and enjoyable experience in creating the film. In which, we won the best film that semester.
