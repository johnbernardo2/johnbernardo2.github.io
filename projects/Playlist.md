summary: "A playlist maker project created in ICS 211"
---

This is a project called “Playlist” which was made in my previous ICS 211 class; created in Java using Visual Sudio Code. It is a program that allows you to perform multiple actions in creating your own music playlist.

My first steps in this were to first brainstorm and create pseudo code. I am still new to coding, so I try to think about what is and isnt neccessary as well as how efficient and minimal I can do to make this project. Starting off with just writing out all the basic sysout questions and outputs into the program, such as “Enter Playlist Title:”.

The second step was to create something simplistic to the user, to assume this is an every day person. In this case, I used a character option menu in which the user is able to add or change parts of the playlist to his liking. When the user creates their playlist title, they are given a selection of character options to choose from. A simple example from that menu would be, “a - add a song” or “d - remove a song.” Let’s say they are preparing for a long road trip and they want to know if their offline playlist will be long enough for it. The user would simple input “t” which is displayed as “t - output total time in playlist.”

This was a good learning experience because I am a person who enjoys music, so it was nice to create a project that aligns with my interests. It helped me refine from what I know from java into applicable learning. Refining my syntax knowledge and basics such as methods and switch statements. It’s a direct and simple program that I think I can show to anyone, even people who do not program.
