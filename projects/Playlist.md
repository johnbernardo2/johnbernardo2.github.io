## Playlist Management Program
The Playlist Management Program was a project I created during my ICS 211 class using Java and Visual Studio Code. This program allows users to perform various actions to create and manage their own music playlists, such as adding and removing songs, calculating total playlist duration, and renaming the playlist.

## Development Process
To start, I brainstormed the program's structure and wrote pseudocode to outline its functionality. As a beginner in coding, I focused on identifying what was essential and how I could design the program to be as efficient and minimalistic as possible. My first step was to implement the basic input and output prompts, such as “Enter Playlist Title,” to lay the foundation for the user interaction.
The next step was to prioritize simplicity for the end user. I designed a character-based menu system to make it intuitive for everyday users. For instance, users could input specific commands like “a” to add a song, “d” to remove a song, or “t” to display the total duration of the playlist. This approach made the program accessible, even to those without technical knowledge. A practical use case might involve a user planning a road trip and wanting to ensure their playlist is long enough for the journey by using the “t” option to calculate total time.

Here's an example in terminal:

```
Enter playlist's title:
Christmas Playlist

Christmas Playlist PLAYLIST MENU
a - Add song
d - Remove song
c - Change position of song
s - Output songs by specific artist
t - Output total time of playlist (in seconds)
o - Output full playlist
q - Quit

Choose an option:

```

## Key Learnings
This project was a significant milestone in my coding journey as it allowed me to apply Java concepts in a practical and creative way. I refined my understanding of syntax, methods, and control structures like switch statements. Additionally, working on a project related to my personal interest in music made the learning process more enjoyable and engaging. The program’s simplicity and relevance also made it something I could confidently demonstrate to others, even those unfamiliar with programming.
