The Ka Papa Lo’i is a service learning event in which volunteers can learn about the land (Aina) and help maintain Hawaiian agriculture. Two locations that I’m aware about and have particapted in about are Ka Papa Lo’i Kanewai, here on campus and Ka Papa Lo’i Punalu’u, North East side of Oahu.

This was a big group activity and my role in this case was first cultivate each of the plants. Going to each taro plant and removing imperfections such as a dead stem and leaf which could be invasive. Then we would either shape the mud around the base and or reinforce it with more mud. The second step was to trample into a differnent parts of soil for preparation. To my knowledge, it was to reinforce and create a more compact inner mud for new and existing taro plants. This went on for about two and a half hours. Then third and final step was to collect boulders from a river in  Punalu’u and bring them to a truck for them to bring to Kanewai Lōi.

I learned the importance of the land and how valuable it is for it to be cared for. in Hawaiian, it is “Mālama ʻĀina” which translates to,“ to take care of the land.” Caring for the land is what provides us resources as the land in turn feeds us and keeps us happy. My interpretation in application is to care for what surrounds you and what brings good to you. Whatever good you put into something, gives you good in return.
