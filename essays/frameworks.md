### Introduction - What is UI Frameworks?

UI Frameworks I think, is a add-on reusable style system to make websites more user-friendly and pretty. For example, think of the top section of the website. You’ll usually see  a logo far to the left, a sign in/sign up button on the far right, and possibly a search bar somewhere in the middle. We call this section the navigation bar. 

In the middle, we have our content area, a place to scroll, like when you’re shopping for goodies on Amazon. 

And on the far bottom, we have the footer section. This is where you’ll often see  the “boring stuff”, eg. “Conditions of Use” or “Privacy Notice”, etc. But it’s also where buisnesses/companies will place helpful links, such as “Contact us” or “Help” for customer support.

So what? It’s just a website?
The point is, these sections help create a smooth website experience. While you may not be thinking, how cool a website is. You’ll be satisfied that you’re able to do all these things easy: logging in, searching for a product, or contacting customer support. And that’s exactly what UI framework is all about - making sure the user interface (UI) intuitive and seamless.

### Why bother to use something like Bootstrap 5? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS?

1. Save you time and effort

Because UI frameworks is a add-on reusable style system, like buttons, navigation bar, footer section. It saves you time from having to create custom css from scratch. You can simply use the bootrap classes to style elements, reducing time spent on repetitive design tasks.

2. Responsive and Cross-platform compatibility

The world is changing in all sorts of ways, a big portion being the technology. From going to the airport to buy a ticket, to ordering a ticket on our computer, to now a tap on our phone. Bootstraps reponsive design allows websites to be responsive to our screen sizes, allowing cross-device compatibility.

3. Large Community

Bootstrap has a large community of developers, resources, and tutorials, and many templates to gain inspiration from. You may look at a website and be able to copy it just using html and css, but the simplicity and experiences of others in the frameworks community will speed up that process for you.
