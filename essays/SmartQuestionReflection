Introduction
Smart questions is a way for programmers or anyone, to effectively ask a question. An effective way to yield a good/proper response without being a nuisance. Asking the question in proper formatting, politely/respectably, in a place where it is proper to do so. Ignoring these guidelines will likely yield you no good or no response at all, even having your question removed.

Why smart questions are important for smart software engineers
I believe smart questions are important for all software engineers. But in this case, why for smart software engineers? Smart questions are crucial for them because it will increase your chances of getting help. Imagine asking someone, “prgrm a calc for me” A surface level question that will likely not get a response. Not only is it impolite and incorrect, it shows that you don't really care or even put effort into learning. Even if it was asked politely and correctly, someone would probably at the most just tell you to google it. It’s basically wasting space on forums and times for others. It’s also important because it also provides value into these forums and communities. If a question has been asked properly and in the right space, someone else could take interest and gain knowledge from it and or help. When these questions are asked and are given context, it allocates effective time for the helper.

How the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions
For a question to be smart, it must fulfill the precepts/guidelines of smart questions. It should have been well researched, proper wording, as well as and understanding to the topic at hand. It is so that the responder is able to gauge and interact efficiently without them having to do more research or try to understand exactly what you are asking. Effort into these questions means you’ve exhausted every single thing you could find, with no avail.
